In this repo you will find a B-Tree Project I completed for school.
I used two classes to create a B-Tree which deals with key-value pairs of Strings.
From the main file you can use the "Insert", "Delete", "Find", and "toString" commands which manipulates the B-Tree.

Feel free to add features or fix any bugs you might find.
